### Welcome!

I am Yannis Rouselakis, a passionate cryptographer and software developer currently contributing as a member of the Technology Promotion Group at NTT Research. Within this dynamic collective, our primary focus revolves around advancing and promoting Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), a cutting-edge field that holds the key to transforming the landscape of secure data transmission.

My primary research interests lie in the intricate world of cryptography, with a particular emphasis on pairing-based cryptography and identity-based encryption. These specialties allow me to explore innovative ways to secure data and communications, ensuring that our digital interactions remain confidential and tamper-resistant.

Beyond the realm of cryptography, I am deeply intrigued by the vast potential of quantum computing. The intersection of Quantum Mechanics and the computational world fascinates me, and I actively engage in exploring the challenges and opportunities presented by quantum computing in the realm of secure information processing. My curiosity extends further into the realms of Computational Complexity and Algorithms, where I seek to unravel the intricacies of efficient problem-solving and the theoretical foundations that underpin modern computation.

As a software developer, I take pride in contributing to the Microsoft Windows Crypto Group's work on building the SymCrypt library. This cryptographic library encompasses a wide array of symmetric, asymmetric, and mathematical primitives, showcasing my dedication to fortifying the security foundations of one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.

In alignment with NTT Research's overarching mission to "Upgrade Reality," our collective efforts strive to push the boundaries of what is possible in the realms of technology and secure communication. We aspire to enhance the fabric of reality itself, leveraging advancements in cryptography, quantum computing, and beyond.
